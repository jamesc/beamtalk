%%% @doc Unified message dispatch entry point.
%%%
%%% **DDD Context:** Runtime / Message Dispatch
%%%
%%% All non-intrinsic message sends are routed through this module,
%%% replacing the inline type-checking code previously generated by
%%% dispatch_codegen.rs (BT-223).
%%%
%%% ## Dispatch Strategy
%%%
%%% | Receiver Type | Dispatch Path | Returns |
%%% |---------------|---------------|---------|
%%% | Actor record  | `beamtalk_actor:sync_send/3` | Value |
%%% | Class object  | `beamtalk_object_class:class_send/3` | Value |
%%% | Primitive     | `beamtalk_primitive:send/3` | Value |
%%%
%%% ## Usage (from generated Core Erlang)
%%%
%%% ```erlang
%%% call 'beamtalk_message_dispatch':'send'(Receiver, 'selector', [Args])
%%% ```
%%%
%%% See: ADR 0006 (Unified Method Dispatch), BT-430, ADR 0043 (BT-918)
