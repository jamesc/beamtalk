/// TranscriptStream — Per-workspace shared log with pub/sub semantics.
///
/// TranscriptStream is a real actor (gen_server) that acts as a shared
/// log within a workspace. Each workspace has its own Transcript instance.
/// Subscribers receive output in real-time; unsubscribed output goes to
/// buffer only. Analogous to Smalltalk's `Transcript` global.
///
/// ## Examples
/// ```beamtalk
/// Transcript show: 'hello'
/// Transcript cr
/// Transcript recent
/// ```
Actor subclass: TranscriptStream
  /// Write a value to the transcript.
  ///
  /// ## Examples
  /// ```beamtalk
  /// Transcript show: 'hello'
  /// Transcript show: 42
  /// ```
  show: value => @primitive 'show:'

  /// Write a newline to the transcript.
  ///
  /// ## Examples
  /// ```beamtalk
  /// Transcript cr
  /// ```
  cr => @primitive 'cr'

  /// Subscribe the calling process to receive transcript output.
  ///
  /// ## Examples
  /// ```beamtalk
  /// Transcript subscribe
  /// ```
  subscribe => @primitive 'subscribe'

  /// Unsubscribe the calling process from transcript output.
  ///
  /// ## Examples
  /// ```beamtalk
  /// Transcript unsubscribe
  /// ```
  unsubscribe => @primitive 'unsubscribe'

  /// Return recent transcript entries as a list.
  ///
  /// ## Examples
  /// ```beamtalk
  /// Transcript recent
  /// ```
  recent => @primitive 'recent'

  /// Clear the transcript buffer.
  ///
  /// ## Examples
  /// ```beamtalk
  /// Transcript clear
  /// ```
  clear => @primitive 'clear'
