# ADR NNNN: Title

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Context
<!-- Problem statement — why this decision is needed -->
<!-- Current state — how things work today -->
<!-- Constraints — what limits the solution space -->

## Decision
<!-- Clear, concise statement of what was decided -->
<!-- Code examples showing the decided approach -->
<!-- REPL session showing the feature in use -->
<!-- Error examples showing what happens on misuse -->

## Prior Art
<!-- How reference languages handle this (Smalltalk, Erlang, Gleam, Newspeak, etc.) -->
<!-- What we adopted, adapted, or rejected and why -->

## User Impact
<!-- How this affects each persona: newcomer, Smalltalk developer, Erlang/BEAM developer, operator -->
<!-- Discoverability and learnability considerations -->

## Steelman Analysis
<!-- Best argument for each rejected alternative from each user cohort -->
<!-- Tension points between cohorts — where reasonable people would disagree -->

## Alternatives Considered
### Alternative Name
<!-- Description, code examples, and why it was rejected -->

## Consequences
### Positive
- 

### Negative
- 

### Neutral

## Implementation
<!-- High-level implementation approach -->
<!-- Affected components (parser, codegen, runtime, REPL) and rough phases -->

## Migration Path
<!-- If this changes existing behavior: how to migrate existing code -->
<!-- Remove this section if not applicable -->
