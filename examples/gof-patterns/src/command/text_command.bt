// Command Pattern — TextCommand (abstract command)
// Declares execute:, which takes a TextBuffer and returns a new TextBuffer.
// Undo is handled by CommandHistory, which saves buffer snapshots before each
// command so no command needs to implement its own reverse logic.

Object subclass: TextCommand
  /// Apply this command to buffer and return the resulting buffer.
