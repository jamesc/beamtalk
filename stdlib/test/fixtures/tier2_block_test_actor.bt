// BT-851/BT-852/BT-853: Tier 2 block round-trip test fixture (ADR 0041 Phase 1).
// Tests that a block with captured mutations can be passed to a HOM via
// self-send and the mutation propagates back to the caller through state threading.

Actor subclass: Tier2BlockTestActor

  // BT-851: HOM that receives a block and calls it with the Tier 2 protocol.
  // The block parameter `aBlock` is compiled with the stateful calling convention
  // when the compiler detects it receives a Tier 2 (captured-mutation) block.
  applyBlock: aBlock to: anItem =>
    aBlock value: anItem

  // BT-853: HOM where the block call is NOT the last expression.
  // After calling the block (which mutates count via StateAcc), this method
  // returns a fixed sentinel value. The state update must still propagate back.
  applyBlockNonLast: aBlock to: anItem =>
    aBlock value: anItem.
    99

  // BT-853: HOM where the block result is captured in a local variable.
  // The block returns (count + x) and this HOM adds an extra offset to it.
  applyBlockGetResult: aBlock to: anItem addend: extra =>
    result := aBlock value: anItem.
    result + extra

  // BT-851: Self-sends applyBlock:to: with a Tier 2 block.
  // The block `[:x | count := count + x]` captures and mutates `count`.
  // After the self-send, `count` should reflect the mutation.
  testRoundTrip =>
    count := 0.
    self applyBlock: [:x | count := count + x] to: 5.
    count

  // BT-853: Non-last Tier 2 value: call — block mutates count, HOM returns sentinel.
  // The state update (count=3) must propagate back through the self-send.
  testNonLastTier2ValueCall =>
    count := 0.
    self applyBlockNonLast: [:x | count := count + x] to: 3.
    count

  // BT-853: Tier 2 block result captured in local variable in the HOM.
  // Block computes (count + x) = (0 + 4) = 4, HOM returns result + 10 = 14.
  testTier2ResultCapture =>
    count := 0.
