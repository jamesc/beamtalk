// MultiExprCalc - value type with multi-expression methods for testing BT-367
// Verifies that non-last expressions in value-type methods are sequenced correctly
// (side effects execute, but only the last expression's value is returned)

Object subclass: MultiExprCalc

  // Two-expression method: first expression is discarded, second is returned
  doubleAfterAdd: x =>
    x abs
    x * 2

  // Three-expression method: first two are discarded, third is returned
  compute: a with: b =>
    a abs
    b abs
    a * b
