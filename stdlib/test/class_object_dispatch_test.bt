// BT-753: Class objects correctly dispatch Object base class methods
// and pure Beamtalk Behaviour methods.

TestCase subclass: ClassObjectDispatchTest

  // --- Object base class methods on class objects (BT-753 core fix) ---

  // Note: respondsTo: on class objects is a known limitation (virtual metaclass
  // tag isn't registered in the class registry). Follow-up issue needed.
